    <h2>Treatment for Lung Cancer</h2>
    <p>
      Lung cancer treatments are carefully customized to the individual, considering factors like the stage of the cancer, overall health, and personal preferences. Treatments range from traditional methods like surgery and chemotherapy to cutting-edge options like immunotherapy and targeted therapy.
    </p>

    <h3>Surgery</h3>
    <p>
      Surgery may involve removing part or all of a lung to eliminate cancerous tissues. Depending on the case, procedures include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wedge resection: Removing a small section of the lung.</li>
      <li>Segmental resection: Removing a larger lung portion.</li>
      <li>Lobectomy: Removing an entire lobe of the lung.</li>
      <li>Pneumonectomy: Removing the entire lung.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Radiation Therapy</h3>
    <p>
      Radiation therapy uses powerful energy beams to target and kill cancer cells. It is commonly used before or after surgery and can also alleviate symptoms for advanced cancer stages.
    </p>

    <h3>Chemotherapy</h3>
    <p>
      Chemotherapy relies on strong medicines to kill cancer cells. Administered intravenously or as pills, it is often used with radiation therapy or before/after surgery.
    </p>

    <h3>Advanced Treatments</h3>
    <p>
      For those who can't undergo surgery or need more precise treatments, advanced options include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Targeted Therapy:</strong> Blocks specific cancer cell growth pathways.</li>
      <li><strong>Immunotherapy:</strong> Helps the immune system attack cancer cells.</li>
      <li><strong>Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy:</strong> Provides precise, high-dose radiation in fewer sessions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Palliative Care</h3>
    <p>
      To enhance the quality of life, palliative care helps manage symptoms and provides support for patients and families throughout treatment.
